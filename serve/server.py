"""serve/server.py - plan v0.3 P8: OpenAI and Anthropic endpoints over any engine that maps token ids to tokens.

    python -m serve.server --engine mock --port 8095            (a scripted engine, for clients and tests)
    python -m serve.server --engine strata --config strata.json --port 8080   (the real engine, resident)

Endpoints: POST /v1/chat/completions (OpenAI, stream and non-stream), POST /v1/messages (Anthropic, stream and
non-stream), GET /v1/models, GET /health. One sequence at a time behind a FIFO (plan: one resident sequence).
Images (optional, when the config has a "vision" entry): OpenAI image_url parts and Anthropic image blocks (base64
data, http(s) URLs or local file paths) go through `strata-vision` (the model's mmproj file) and reach the engine as
embeddings (`GENI`).  JPEG/PNG/BMP/GIF go straight in; WebP, TIFF, AVIF, ... (agents like omp send WebP) are
converted to PNG first with Pillow.
Requests whose prompt plus max tokens exceed the engine's context are REJECTED with 400, never truncated.
An unset (or 0, or -1) max tokens means "unlimited": whatever the prompt leaves of the context.

The engine boundary is `Engine.generate(prompt_ids, max_new, sampling, cancel) -> iterator of token ids`.
`StrataEngine` keeps one `strata --serve` process resident (weights, expert arena and VRAM tier load once) and
talks to it over stdin/stdout; `MockEngine` is a scripted stand-in that makes every API path testable without a GPU.

Lifecycle: the engine process is optional.  `--no-preload` serves with no engine at all; the first request starts
it, and `--idle-unload SECONDS` (or `"idle_unload_s"` in the run config) frees its RAM and VRAM again after that
much idle time.  `POST /api/inference/load`, `POST /api/inference/unload`, `GET /api/inference/status` and
`GET /api/inference/load-progress` expose the same contract as Unsloth Studio's inference routes, so one client can
drive either server.  `load`/`unload` bodies are padded to survive a proxy that times slow teardowns out.
